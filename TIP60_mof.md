- is the catalytoc center of the [[NuA4 complex]]
- well characterised involvement in transcriptional regulation 
- co-activator for several proteins
	- hormone receptors
	- beta-catenin
	- [[nfkappab]]
	- [[c-myc]]
	- [[E2F]]
- required for [[apoptosis]] induction through [[p53]] acetylation
- involved in double strand DNA repair through acetylation of [[ATM]] 
	- ATM rapidly phosphorylates a large number of proteins, and starting signalling cascades 
	- lead to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
