- binds to [[GR]]
- is an common immmunosuppressive
- induces the expression of [[JADE2]], leading to degradation of [[LSD1]]
- diffuses through plasma membranes and assembles into intracellular complexes with [[GR]] and hsp90

### inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediator release
- downregulation of [[IL-1beta]], [[IL-6]], [[il-12]], [[TNFa]], [[gm-csf]]
- downregulation of chemokines [[IL-8]], [[CCL5]] and [[CCL2]]
- inhibit inflammatory effectors such as [[iNOS]] and [[COX-2]]

### genomic actions 

#### tethering of other receptors
- through tethering, GC inhibits [[nfkappab]] and [[AP-1]] in a physical way
- induces gluconeogenisis 
- inhibition of [[LPS]] induced proinflammatory gene expression
	- about half the LPS genes are sensitive to GC stimulus 
	- the effect is mediated inhibition of with [[rela]] and [[IRF3]] through interaction with [[rela|p65]] 
	- induction of [[PPARgamma]] supports  this repression
- influences [[IL-6]], tnfa, cox-2
- does not influence il-1b, ccl2, ccl3 and Cxcl10 expression --> other mechanism 
- inhibition of antigen presentation on [[MHCII|MHC2]] due to inhibition of binding of [[XBP1]] to the X box in the mhc2 locus 
	- mechanism seems to be simple blockage of x box, could also target RFX5
#### histone related emchanisms
- transcriptional repression of Il-8 or GM-CSF involves [[histone 4]] deacetylation by[[HDAC2]]
-  GC upregulates [[SAP30]], a member of the [[sin3_hdac]] repressor complex on both protein and mRNA level

#### mRNA stability
- GC mediated decrease in mRNA stability of [[iNOS]] was also dependent on [[class 1 deacetylase|HDAC]]
- may induce mRNA instability factors such as ZFP36L2
	- also binding of [[GR]] to specific mRNA directly

## non-genomic actions 
- GC can, in an GR-independent way, inhibit phagocytosis and superoxid production through intercalation into the plasma membrane 
- inhibition of [[IRAK1]] downstream of [[TLR9]] through direct physical interaction leads to a reduction of induced cytokines 
	- rapid effect <30 min
- membrane-bound GRs (mGR) are upregulated by [[LPS]] and downregulated by GC
	- involved in autoimmune diseases

## Induction of Anti-inflammatory Mediators
- indcution of [[Annexin A1]]
	- annexin a1 and GC share a lot of mechanisms, it may be an autocrine modulator of GC in monocytes 
	- the reduction of LPS induced secretion il-6 and tnf was annexin a1 dependent and mediated by [[GILZ]]
- induction of [[il-10]]
	- induction found in [[monocytes]], macropahges, b cells 
	- leads to distinct program
	- depends on the cell cycle
- induction of [[CD163]]
	- single dose of GC is enough for a fast and sustained upregulation of [[CD163]]
	- can be shed from the membrane

## transcriptional effects
- indcution of [[nfkappab]] inhibitor [[ikappabalpha]] in [[monocytes]]
- indcution of [[GILZ]] --> downregulation of [[nfkappab]] transcriptional effects
- induction of [[MKP-1]] leads to a general inhibition of the the [[MAP kinase]] pathway
	- this includes map kinasess ERK and c-jun n terminal kinases (JNK)
	- this pathway is important for the por-inflammaotry effects of LPS stimuls, and is inhibited by MKP-1
	- p38 MAPK stabalises pro-inflammatory mRNA, which is inhibited by MKP-1
- dual effects with regardes to [[IL-1beta]]: 
	- indcution of [[IL-1RII]] --> anti-inflammatory
	- repression of [[IL-1RA]] --> pro-inflammatory
- induction of ADAMTS2, a metalloprotease involved in wound healing

## phagocytotic effects
- GC increase the phagocytic capacity for human macrophages with regards to apoptotic cells 
- endogenous GCs are also important for this process
	- macrophages express 11Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, converting inactive cortisone into cortisol, the active form
		- check expression
- Gc induced ecpression patterns help the process, for example Annexin A1 works as an opsonins for apoptotic cells
- boosts of the [[complement system]] (i.e C1q) also has a positive effect on phagocytosis
- induction of CD163 and MerTK
- increased uptake of bacteria



## effects on antigen presentation
-  downregualtion of [[MHCII|MHC2]] via the blockage of the X-box 
- downregulation of [[CD80]] and [[cd86]] needed for co stimulation of t cells
