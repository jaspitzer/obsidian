aliases: [glucocorticoids, dexa, prednisolone]
---
- binds to [[GR]]
- is an common immmunosuppressive
- induces the expression of [[JADE2]], leading to degradation of [[LSD1]]
- diffuses through plasma membranes and assembles into intracellular complexes with [[GR]] and hsp90

### inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediator release
- downregulation of [[IL-1beta]], [[IL-6]], [[il-12]], [[TNFa]], [[gm-csf]]
- downregulation of chemokines [[IL-8]], [[CCL5]] and [[CCL2]]
- inhibit inflammatory effectors such as [[iNOS]] and [[COX-2]]

### genomic actions 

#### tethering of other receptors
- through tethering, GC inhibits [[nfkappab]] and [[AP-1]] in a physical way
- induces gluconeogenisis 
- inhibition of [[LPS]] induced proinflammatory gene expression
	- about half the LPS genes are sensitive to GC stimulus 
	- the effect is mediated inhibition of with [[rela]] and [[IRF3]] through interaction with [[rela|p65]] 
	- induction of [[PPARgamma]] supports  this repression
- influences [[IL-6]], tnfa, cox-2
- does not influence il-1b, ccl2, ccl3 and Cxcl10 expression --> other mechanism 
#### histone related emchanisms
- transcriptional repression of Il-8 or GM-CSF involves [[histone 4]] deacetylation by[[HDAC2]]
-  GC upregulates [[SAP30]], a member of the [[sin3_hdac]] repressor complex on both protein and mRNA level

#### mRNA stability
- GC mediated decrease in mRNA stability of [[iNOS]] was also dependent on [[class 1 deacetylase|HDAC]]
- may induce mRNA instability factors such as ZFP36L2
	- also binding of [[GR]] to specific mRNA directly

## non-genomic actions 
- GC can, in an GR-independent way, inhibit phagocytosis and superoxid production through intercalation into the plasma membrane 
- inhibition of [[IRAK1]] downstream of [[TLR9]] through direct physical interaction leads to a reduction of induced cytokines 
	- rapid effect <30 min
- membrane-bound GRs (mGR) are upregulated by [[LPS]] and downregulated by GC
	- involved in autoimmune diseases

## Induction of Anti-inflammatory Mediators
- indcution of [[Annexin A1]]
	- annexin a1 and GC share a lot of mechanisms, it may be an autocrine modulator of GC in monocytes 
	- the reduction of LPS induced secretion il-6 and tnf was annexin a1 dependent and mediated by GILZ
- induction of [[il-10]]
	- induction found in [[monocytes]], macropahges, b cells 
	- leads to distinct program
	- depends on the cell cycle
- induction of [[CD163]]
	- single dose of GC is enough for a fast and sustained upregulation of [[CD163]]
	- can be shed from the membrane
