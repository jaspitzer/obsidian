- members include [[nf-ya]], [[nf-yb]] and [[nf-yc]]
- recognise the Y box element upstream of promotor regions 
	- motif is also called the CCAAT-Box 
- nf-yb and nf-yc contain histone-fold domains exibiting homology to histone 2a and histone 2b, which might point to a competetive approach in DNA binding between NF-y family and [[Nucleosome]]s
- induces a structural bend in the DNA which could enhance nucleosome destabilisation
