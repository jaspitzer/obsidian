aliases: [lysine-specific demethylase-1, lysine specific demethylase 1, lysine-specific demethylase 1, KDM1A]
---
- member of the oxidase family 
- catalysies the demthylation of lysine side chain on proteins, including [[H3K4me3]] and [[H3K4me2]]
- is involved in a variety of different pathways
	- stem cell maintenance
	- development
	- carcinogenisis 
- suppresses OXPHOS epigeneticly through h3k4 demethylation 
	- [source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22453831)
- is degraded through [[JADE2]] in the context of [[dexamethasone]] treatment 
- involved in metabolic control --> expression inhibits [[oxphos]]
