aliases: [lysine-specific demethylase-1, lysine specific demethylase 1, lysine-specific demethylase 1, KDM1A]
---
- member of the oxidase family 
- catalysies the demthylation of lysine side chain on proteins, including [[H3K4me3]] and [[H3K4me2]]
	- preference for mono- or dimnethylated targets
- is involved in a variety of different pathways
	- stem cell maintenance
	- development
	- carcinogenisis 
- suppresses OXPHOS epigeneticly through h3k4 demethylation 
	- [source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22453831)
- is degraded through [[JADE2]] in the context of [[dexamethasone]] treatment 
- involved in metabolic control --> expression inhibits [[oxphos]]
- shown to interact with different member of the [[CoREST]] complex in a synergistic way
- well described in the context of AML, where it maintains stem cell self-renewal and regulates cell differentiation 
- interacts with [[Snail_gfi1]] family of transcriptional repressors
- can function as a part of either the [[NuRD complex]], or [[sin3_hdac]] complex
- in hormone responsive cells, LSD1 binds the free receptors, forming a DNA bound complex with the [[CoREST]] complex, leading to robust expressional shutdown
	- upon hormone stimulation, the complex dissolves and the regions becom transcriptionally active 

### transcriptional activation

- activity is dependent on hormone receptor signalling: when the hormone receptor --> PKCbeta --> phsosphorylation of histone 3 threonine 6
	- this enables the interaction with repressive marks H3k9me1-2, leading to the demethylation and transcriptional activation 
- transcriptional activation can also happen in the context of [[retinoic acid receptor]]
