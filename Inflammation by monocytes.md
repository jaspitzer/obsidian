upon [[NLRP3]] (inflammasome) activation, monocytes release IL-1beta, one of the most potent inflammatory signals

through activates caspase-1, pro-IL-1beta is cleaved, also gasdermin D --> leading to cell death and cytokine release
release of LDH is symptomatic of pyroptosis and the other forms of necrotic cell death
