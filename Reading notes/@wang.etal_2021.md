# SARS-CoV-2 Restructures the Host Chromatin Architecture   
Published 2021 in bioRxiv


## Abstract
 
 SARS-CoV-2 has made >190-million infections worldwide, thus it is pivotal to understand the viral impacts on host cells. Many viruses can significantly alter host chromatin, but such roles of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown. Here, we characterized the three-dimensional (3D) genome architecture and epigenome landscapes in human cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection, revealing remarkable restructuring of host chromatin architecture. High-resolution Hi-C 3.0 uncovered widespread A compartmental weakening and A-B mixing, together with a global reduction of intra-TAD chromatin contacts. The cohesin complex, a central organizer of the 3D genome, was significantly depleted from intra-TAD regions, supporting that SARS-CoV-2 disrupts cohesin loop extrusion. Calibrated ChIP-Seq verified chromatin restructuring by SARS-CoV-2 that is particularly manifested by a pervasive reduction of euchromatin modifications. Built on the rewired 3D genome/epigenome maps, a modified activity-by-contact model highlights the transcriptional weakening of antiviral interferon response genes or virus sensors (e.g., DDX58) incurred by SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, pro-inflammatory genes (e.g. IL-6) high in severe infections were uniquely regulated by augmented H3K4me3 at their promoters. These findings illustrate how SARS-CoV-2 rewires host chromatin architecture to confer immunological gene deregulation, laying a foundation to characterize the long-term epigenomic impacts of this virus.

## key points:
- disruption of chromatin loops and short range interactions
- no clear control, may just be viral infection itself
- ab mixing, with loop boundaries mostly intact 
- strong, gloabl downregulation of [[H3K27Ac]] after infections, no changes in [[H3K4me3]]
- show decrease looping and activation for IFN dependent genes,

## Notes: 
- not a very strong study
- work in epithelial cells
- no viral control
