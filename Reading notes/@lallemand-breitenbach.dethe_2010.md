Published 2010 in Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology
Is a review

## Abstract
 
 PML nuclear bodies are matrix-associated domains that recruit an astonishing variety of seemingly unrelated proteins. Since their discovery in the early 1960s, PML bodies have fascinated cell biologists because of their beauty and their tight association with cellular disorders. The identification of PML, a gene involved in an oncogenic chromosomal translocation, as the key organizer of these domains drew instant interest onto them. The multiple levels of PML body regulation by a specific posttranslational modification, sumoylation, have raised several unsolved issues. Functionally, PML bodies may sequester, modify or degrade partner proteins, but in many ways, PML bodies still constitute an enigma., PML bodies are nuclear structures that seem to sequester, modify, and degrade certain proteins. PML and/or partner sumoylation was proposed to be the glue that holds them together.

## key points:
- a "new" kind of nuclear structure 
- pml bodies are stress induced in multiple contexts
- pml bodies accumulate and sequester a large variety of partner proteins, causing co-localisation
- this co-localisation can have variety of functions, like induction of [[apoptosis]], senescence, transcriptional control, DNA damage repair, telomer-extension
- key modification seems to be sumoylation, which kind of marks protein of PML body localisation
- protective role in the context of dna virus infection
- induces by interferons

## Notes: 
- [[PML]] is a protein is involved in nuclear organisation 
- [[PML nuclear bodies]] are spheres with 0.1-1 µm diameter, associated with the nuclear matrix 
	- colocalisation with [[SP100]]
- components are induces by [[type 1 ifn]] and [[type 2 ifn]]
- the status or pml bodies are interconnected with the status of the cell as a whole 
- recruitment of a ~ 100 partner protein by PML, with the most prominent one being [[SUMO]]
- several forms of PML bodies exist, but in general are formed in response to some stress
- pml bodies are devoid of RNA or DNA, but can, as a whole interact with DNA
	- translocation to a repressor locus was shown
- intense interactions with DNA viruses, with accumulation of viral genome around the bodies, or within them 
	- show a protective role in the context of DNa viruses in colaboration with DAXX and SP100
- links to DNA damage repair and telomerase maintenance
	- PML bodies might be the vesicle containign the machinery
