# Nucleosome eviction from MHC class II promoters controls positioning of the transcription start site   
Published 2009 in Nucleic Acids Research


## Abstract
 
 Nucleosome depletion at transcription start sites (TSS) has been documented genome-wide in multiple eukaryotic organisms. However, the mechanisms that mediate this nucleosome depletion and its functional impact on transcription remain largely unknown. We have studied these issues at human MHC class II (MHCII) genes. Activation-induced nucleosome free regions (NFR) encompassing the TSS were observed at all MHCII genes. Nucleosome depletion was exceptionally strong, attaining over 250-fold, at the promoter of the prototypical HLA-DRA gene. The NFR was induced primarily by the transcription factor complex that assembles on the conserved promoter-proximal enhancer situated upstream of the TSS. Functional analyses performed in the context of native chromatin demonstrated that displacing the NFR without altering the sequence of the core promoter induced a shift in the position of the TSS. The NFR thus appears to play a critical role in transcription initiation because it directs correct TSS positioning in vivo. Our results provide support for a novel mechanism in transcription initiation whereby the position of the TSS is controlled by nucleosome eviction rather than by promoter sequence.

## key points:
- for me personally, the concept of [[Nucleosome]] eviction was new: the removal of nucleosomes, creation of a nucleosome free region, necessary for the start of transcription
	- this is, what is measured in ATAC seq, fragments of DNA so short, they are not bound to any nucleosomes
 - average nucleosome depletion is <1.5 fold to > 4 fold
	- depends on species, genes and method 
- measure of nucleosome occupancy by chipping against [[histone 3]] --> really fucking smart
- nucleosome free regions within the MCH2 loci are fairly atypical by being fairly large and consistent

## Notes: 
- upon ifn stimulation, [[RFX5]], [[CREB]], [[NF-Y family]], [[CIITA]] and [[RNApol2]] bind to the promotor region of [[MHCII|MHC2]]
	- nf-y also binds baseline, as does CREB
	- the strongest differences are within CIITA and RNApol2
- CIITA KO only abrogates binding of CIITA, whereas RFX KO inhibits binding of CIITA
- lack of nucleosomes around the TSS/promotor region is dependent on RFX and only partially on CIITA
	- nucleosome eviction dependent on the enhancesome assembly 
		- not enough for transcriptional initiation
-  no change in histone modifications for this nucleosome eviction
	- relatively interesting 
- BRG1, part of the [[swi_snf]] complex, is important for [[MHCII|MHC2]] gene activation and is recruited to the promotor by CIITA and RFX 
	- in the context of nucleosome eviction, BRG1 occupancy was not relevant
- nucleosome eviction was important for all MHC2 promotors
- the eviction of the nucleosomes plays a role in the selection of the TSS for HLA-DRA 
- increasing the distance between the S-Y box and the TSS through the creation of inserts led to a reduction of nucleosome eviction around the TSS and subsequent reduction of expression of a reporter gene 
	- kinda counter intuitive, as CIITA is widely recognised as the master regulator of MHC2 expression - nucleosome eviction is mostly independent of CIITA, and drives expression - goes against the curren model
