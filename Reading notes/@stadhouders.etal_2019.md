# Transcription factors and 3D genome conformation in cell-fate decisions   
Published 2019 in Nature

Review

## Abstract
 
 How cells adopt different identities has long fascinated biologists. Signal transduction in response to environmental cues results in the activation of transcription factors that determine the gene-expression program characteristic of each cell type. Technological advances in the study of 3D chromatin folding are bringing the role of genome conformation in transcriptional regulation to the fore. Characterizing this role of genome architecture has profound implications, not only for differentiation and development but also for diseases including developmental malformations and cancer. Here we review recent studies indicating that the interplay between transcription and genome conformation is a driving force for cell-fate decisions.

Key points:
- describes genome organisation in relation to transcription and cell fate 
- genome organisation and expression go hand in hand - one defines the other 
- chromosomes are organised in specific territories
- several chromosomes can meet in an [[interchromosomal hub]], collecting transcriptionally active chromatin
- chromosome is organised in [[A compartment]]s and [[B comparment]]s; A compartments collect active chromatin, b compartments contains mostly heterochromatin and are anriched for at the nuclear lamina 
- within A comparments, [[TAD]]s exist to facilitate enhancer promotor interactions over larger distances 
- TADs are formed by [[CTCF]] in collaboration with cohesin
	- chromatin domains have a direction 
	- other ways to arganise chromatin exist
- other factors, such as [[oct4]] and KLF4 could also have influences on TAD organisation
- TAD is the organisational unit, in which most promotor and enhancer interactions work, showing unified chromatin modifications

## Notes: 
- loads of large concepts, but not a lot of meat I think
