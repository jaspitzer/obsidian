# Severe COVID-19 associated variants linked to chemokine receptor gene control in monocytes and macrophages   
Published 2021 in bioRxiv

## Abstract
 
 Genome-wide association studies have identified 3p21.31 as the main risk locus for severe disease in COVID-19 patients, although underlying biological mechanisms remain elusive. We performed a comprehensive epigenomic dissection of the 3p21.31 locus, identifying a CTCF-dependent tissue-specific 3D regulatory chromatin hub that controls the activity of several tissue-homing chemokine receptor (CCR) genes in monocytes and macrophages. Risk SNPs colocalized with regulatory elements and were linked to increased expression of CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5 in monocytes and macrophages. As excessive organ infiltration of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages is a hallmark of severe COVID-19, our findings provide a rationale for the genetic association of 3p21.31 variants with elevated risk of hospitalization upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.

## Key points:
- one of the main Loci associated with higher risk in COVID is 3p21.31, a [[CTCF]] locus controlling the expression of [[CCR1]], [[CCr2]], and [[CCR5]] 
	- not necessarily ccr1 on [[monocytes]], as these are also expressed on T cells and nk cells 
- ctcf sites cause chromatin looping, inducing CCR1, CCR2
- snp drive expression of CCR1, CCr5, leading to stronger disease phenotype, as (probably) more monocytes are recruited into the lungs

## Notes: 

- interesting study regarding the effect of SNPs on gene expression
- might be worth checking CCR1 expression
