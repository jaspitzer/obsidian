- several pairs exist in contrast to the yeast Set1
	- KMT2a/KMT2B
	- KMT2C/KMT2D
	- KMT2F/KMT2G
- they are usually present in a larger complex required for activity and triggereing the different stats of methylation
	- partners include [[WDR5]], [[ASH2L]], [[RBBP5]], and [[DPY30]]
- KMT2A-D is also known as MLL1-4
	- can be part of the [[COMPASS_MLL|MLL complex]]
