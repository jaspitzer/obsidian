  abstract = {While footprinting analysis of ATAC-seq data can theoretically enable investigation of transcription factor (TF) binding, the lack of a computational tool able to conduct different levels of footprinting analysis has so-far hindered the widespread application of this method. Here we present TOBIAS, a comprehensive, accurate, and fast footprinting framework enabling genome-wide investigation of TF binding dynamics for hundreds of TFs simultaneously. We validate TOBIAS using paired ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq data, and find that TOBIAS outperforms existing methods for bias correction and footprinting. As a proof-of-concept, we illustrate how TOBIAS can unveil complex TF dynamics during zygotic genome activation in both humans and mice, and propose how zygotic Dux activates cascades of TFs, binds to repeat elements and induces expression of novel genetic elements.},

Both IgG and IgM titers plateaued within 6 days after seroconversion. Serological testing may be helpful for the diagnosis of suspected patients with negative RT\textendash PCR results and for the identification of asymptomatic infections.},

  abstract = {GCN5 is a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) originally identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and required for transcription of specific genes within chromatin as part of the SAGA (SPT-ADA-GCN5 acetylase) coactivator complex. Mammalian cells have two distinct GCN5 homologs (PCAF and GCN5L) that have been found in three different SAGA-like complexes (PCAF complex, TFTC [TATA-binding-protein-free TAFII-containing complex], and STAGA [SPT3-TAFII31-GCN5L acetylase]). The composition and roles of these mammalian HAT complexes are still poorly characterized. Here, we present the purification and characterization of the human STAGA complex. We show that STAGA contains homologs of most yeast SAGA components, including two novel human proteins with histone-like folds and sequence relationships to yeast SPT7 and ADA1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that STAGA has acetyl coenzyme A-dependent transcriptional coactivator functions from a chromatin-assembled template in vitro and associates in HeLa cells with spliceosome-associated protein 130 (SAP130) and DDB1, two structurally related proteins. SAP130 is a component of the splicing factor SF3b that associates with U2 snRNP and is recruited to prespliceosomal complexes. DDB1 (p127) is a UV-damaged-DNA-binding protein that is involved, as part of a complex with DDB2 (p48), in nucleotide excision repair and the hereditary disease xeroderma pigmentosum. Our results thus suggest cellular roles of STAGA in chromatin modification, transcription, and transcription-coupled processes through direct physical interactions with sequence-specific transcription activators and with components of the splicing and DNA repair machineries.},

  abstract = {The Ada2a-containing (ATAC) complex is an essential Drosophila melanogaster histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex that contains the transcriptional cofactors Gcn5 (KAT2), Ada3, Ada2a, Atac1 and Hcf. We have analyzed the complex by MudPIT (multidimensional protein identification technology) and found eight previously unidentified subunits. These include the WD40 repeat protein WDS, the PHD and HAT domain protein CG10414 (herein renamed Atac2/KAT14), the YEATS family member D12, the histone fold proteins CHRAC14 and NC2{$\beta$}, CG30390, CG32343 (Atac3) and CG10238. The presence of CG10414 (Atac2) suggests that it acts as a second acetyltransferase enzyme in ATAC in addition to Gcn5. Indeed, recombinant Atac2 displays HAT activity in vitro with a preference for acetylating histone H4, and mutation of Atac2 abrogated H4 lysine 16 acetylation in D. melanogaster embryos. Furthermore, although ATAC does not show nucleosome-remodeling activity itself, it stimulates nucleosome sliding by the ISWI, SWI\textendash SNF and RSC complexes.},
