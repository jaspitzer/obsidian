Key points: 
- [[monocytes]] are infected via anti sars antibodies using FcgammaR
- [[covid]] Infection is not productive, but is aborted through [[NLRP3]], [[gasdermin D]] leading to pyroptosis
- [[pyroptosis]] contributes to the systemic inflammation

## Covid-19 blood shows signs of pyroptosis 
- healthy 19, emergency room covid patients (22)
- extracted monocytes for [[FACS]] analysis
	- stained with [[FACS#Annexin V]] and [[FACS#Zombie yellow]]
	- increase in covid patients of Zombie^+ --> mark of [[pyroptosis]] 
	- no change in lymphcytes
- monocyte subtype changes
	- classical monocytes were reduced in frequency
	- intermediate monocytes were increase
	- no change in non classical 
- virus uptake 
	- 60% of intermediate monos and 40 of non-classical monocytes had taken up virus (stained for [[covid#n protein]]) 

- the pateints showed increases in [[Inflammation by monocytes#inflammation markers]] except IL-17, however, no increase in IFN 
- all patients show increase in [[pyroptosis#Pyroptosis markers]] when compared with healthy donors  
	- IL-1beta still low, but significantly increase
	- il-1RA significantly increase

- patients were staged using the [[MGH COVID Acuity scale]]
- staging lead to divergence, with more severe patients showing increased GSDMD LDH, IL-1RA and IL-18

## Monocytes have activated inflammasomes
- to check for pyroptosis, NLRP3 components were investigeted freshly isolated monocytes from pateints, healthy donors and non covid patients
- GSDMD, ASC and activate caspase-1 
- 4% of monocytes specked, 1% of non covid infected patients, non of the HD 
- higher grade of activation in covid when compared to other respiratory viruses
- asc speck formation correlated with membrane reorgasnisation adn GSDMD redistribution
- most zombie + cells had asc specks 
- GSDMD full length was mostly detected in healthy patients
- GSDMD c terminal domain was only found in covid patients (and positive control)

- microscopy confirmed colocalisation of NLRP3 components, as well as [[AIM2]]
	- aim2 was unexpected, according to the authors


## monocyte infection triggers pyroptosis 
- internalisation of sars-cov2, as measured by internal [[covid n protein]] and the presence of dsRNA inside the monocytes, correlates with specking
	- dsRNA staining via J2
- the N protein is not taken as a measure of infection, but sensing of dsRNA is --> ongoing infection 
- almost all J2 positive cells were also specking --> infection triggers the inflammasome 

## lung macrophages have inflammasome specks 
- using fixed tissue slides, [[covid n protein]] was discovered in a multitude of cells, but only in in [[CD14]] positve cells it correlated with ASC specks 
- some off-target effects through [[DAMPS]] were present

## CD16 mediates infection of opsonized virus
- engeneered virus was created and put onto monocytes, together with antibodies 
- infection of monocytes increased in the presence of antibodies or plasma of covid patients 
- the neutralisation strength of antibodies did not affect the infection rate
- blocking of CD16 via AB or the depletion of IgG lead to a strong reduction in infection rate 
- vaccination did not increase chances of infection whne compared to HD or covid patient plasma 
## SARS-CoV2 monocyte infection is aborted
- inhibition of viral RNA-dependent RNA pol lead to lower infection rates, but inhibition of TMPRSS2, did not
	- TMPRSS2 primes covid spike protein for ACE2 mediated entry
- anti ACE2 ab did not slow infection 


### limitations
- investigatinos of dying cells in the metabolism are difficult
	- clearance of dead/dying cells
	- freezing dyeing cells is impossible, they just die
