#### Sepsis
- used as a target of sepsis trials using [[IL-1RA]] as a way to dampen the effect of IL-1beta
- lead to reduction, but not significant across multiple trials 

#### Non-infectious, chronic inflammation scenarios 
- blockage of IL-1beta is the standard thrapy for a autoinflammatory diseases

### signalling 
- occurs through IL-1RI, via [[myd88]], iraks and [[nfkappab]]
- il-1alpha can signal thorugh its inactive form, causing the release of IL-8 in absence of receptor binding on the cell surface

- signalling on the receptor side is mediated by the TIR domain, a domain also present in [[TLRs]]
- decoy receptor [[IL-1RII]] and, in the brain, [[IL-1RAcP#IL-1RAcPb]]
- decoy signalling, i.e. blockage of receptor occurs through [[IL-1RA]]
