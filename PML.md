- important protein for signalling complexes
- allows the formation of [[pml nuclear bodies]]
- member of the TRIM/RBCC family of proteins
	- many members are ubiquitin ligases that generate subcellular structures through autoassembly 
- induced by [[ifnbeta]], [[ifnalpha]] and [[type 2 ifn|ifngamma]]
- also induced by p53

- several isoforms exist, with several carboxyl-termina determining varying specificity
- can induce senescence and [[apoptosis]], in part through [[p53]] activation
- upon activating stimulus, PML is sumoylated by  one of a range of DNA damage or stress activated kinases
	- sumoylation seems to a important, not only for pml but also its partners
- proximity to PML bodies is associated with actively transcribed loci
