-  stands for inhibitor of growth
- serve as epigenetic reades that recruit [[HAT]]s or [[class 1 deacetylase|HDAC]]
- part of the same complexes
- alter local chromatin structure
- knowckout show strong immune phenotypes in ING1 and ING4
- ING1, ING2 and [[ING4]] show an effect on [[apoptosis]]
- ings 1 and 2 recruit the [[sin3_hdac]] complex 
- bind to [[histone 3|H3]]k4  
- affinity for H3K4 is mediated by the methylation status, with [[H3K4me3]] having the stronges affinity
- have a lamin interaction domain (LID), which allows for interaction with [[lamin-A]]
- also have a leucine zipper like domain (LZL) mediates the affinity for [[sin3_hdac]] in ING2
	- every ING exept ING1

- ing1 and/or ing2 are involved in [[p53]] transcriptional activity through acetylation of p53 by recruiting [[p300]] and the [[CBP_p300]] [[HAT]]
- ING2 works in combination with SIRT1 to regulate [[HDAC1]] activity
