- a recepptor for [[IL-1beta]]
- gene symbol: IL1R2
- a receptor analouge of IL-1RI, but lacks the TIR domain, so no attachment of myd88
- also sequesteres [[IL-1RAcP]]
- as a higher affinity for IL-1beta than IL-1RI --> sequenstering of IL-1beta
- present mostly on macrophages and b cells
- also known as the decoy receptor
