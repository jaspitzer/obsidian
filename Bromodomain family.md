aliases: [BRD family]
---
- family of acetylbinding proteins 
- readers of the histone code 
- can read [[histone 3|H3]] and [[histone 4]] acetylation 
- can recuit [[P-tefb]] and control [[RNA pol 2|rnapol2]] activity
- has several members
	- [[BRD2]]
	- [[BRD3]]
	- [[BRD4]]
	- [[BRDT]]
- can also interact with several TFs
- can interact with the trascnription elongation complexes
- interaction with [[histones]] acetylations in promotors and enhancers allows for initiation of genen transcription 
- can recruit cofactors and additional TFs
- BRD2-4 are present in activated immune cells
