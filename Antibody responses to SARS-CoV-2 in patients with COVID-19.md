- tested the antobody response early in the [[covid]] pandemic
- 285 patients, 100% produced anti covid antibody 
- seroconvertion for IgG and IgM occurred sequencially or simultaneously 
- plateau 6 days after seroconversion
- antibody against both [[covid n protein]] and [[covid spike protein]]


antibodies against [[mers]] and [[Sars-cov1]] detactable in 80-100% of patients 2 weeks after sympotoms

- severe patients show higher titers, both in IgG and IgM 
- 20 fold difference between patients in their plateau phase 
- no correlation between serum IgG and clinical representation
