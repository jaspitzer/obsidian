- serves as a coreceptor for IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-36 and IL-33
- necessary for successful signalling 
- _IL1RAP_ is the gene symbol 


## IL-1RAcPb
- unique variant in the brain 
- lowers the activity of il-1beta
- does not recruit myd88 and associated kinases 
- partial signalling takes place ?
