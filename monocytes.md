- originate in the bone marrow and migrate through the bloodstream 
- can differentiate into [[macrophages]] or [[dendritic cells ]]
- powerful producers of cytokines and chemokines
# monocyte subtypes
## classical monocytes 
- [[CD14]] high, [[CD16]] - 
- make up ~ 80-90% of all blood monocytes

## intermediate monocytes
- CD14 high, CD16+ 
- higher in phagocytosis, as CD16 is an importent receptor for antibody mediated phagocytosis
- higher in antigen presentation 

## non classical monocytes
- CD14^low CD16^+ 



# production of cytokines
- a large range of cytokines are induced in monocytes
- [[IL-6]]
- [[TNFa]]
- [[IL-7]]
- [[IL-17]]
- [[CCL7]]
- [[CxCL10]]
- [[G-CSF]]
- [[GM-CSF]]
- [[il-1beta]]
