- is the basic building block of eukaryotic chromatin 
- consists of 137 bp of DNA wrapped around anoctamer of histones
	- histone 3
	- histone 4
	- histone 2a 
	- histone 2b
- packlaging of DNa into nucleosome restricts access to the DNA for transcription factors adn the like 
- in general, nucleosomes are depleted surrounding the promotor regions of genes, including their TSS 
- also, specific enhancers deplete nucleosomes near their binding site 
- factors for nucleosome depletion:
	- dna structure
	- assembly of the preinitiation complex containing  [[RNA pol 2]]
	- binding sequence of certain TFs
	- chromatin remodeling
