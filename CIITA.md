- transcriptional coactivator of [[MHCII]] protein
- only found as mRNA in cells expressing [[MHCII]]
	- induces by [[type 2 ifn|ifngamma]] in non antigen presentign cells pCAF
- thought to work in combination with [[RFX5]]
- recognises the complex formed by [[RFX5]], [[CREB]] and [[NF-Y family]]
- can function as a acetyltransferase // has [[HAT]] activity

- upregulates [[MHCI]] in response to [[ifngamma]]
- short half-life with around 30 min

## post-translational modifications
- important for functions
- phosphorylation regulates nucelar localisation adn self-interaction 
- acetylation by [[PCAF]]and [[CBP]] is important for nuclear translocation and activity
- [[HDAC1]] interacts with ciita and restricts its interaction with the enhancesome 
- [[HDAC2]] deacetylates CIITA and  targets it for degradation

- monoubiquitylation stabilises ciita at the MHCII promotor
	- required phosphorylation of a nearby serine
