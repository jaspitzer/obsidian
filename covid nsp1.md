- a [[covid]] protein
- nsp == non structural protein
- also called the shut- off protein, as it inhibtis [[translation]] via interaction with the 40S subunit of the ribosome
- among the first proteins to be translated upon infection

# mechanisms of action in SARS-CoV1
- mRNA degradation 
- inhibition of translation 
- suppression of [[type 1 ifn]] expression 
	- found in complex with 40S subunit and inhibts mRNA binding

	- found in complex with 80S subunit and [[LYAR]]
		- https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abc8665
	- blocks ifn related translation
- the mechanism of inhibition does not seem to be specific, i.e. host protein translation is inhibited and viral tranlation can continue, but instead it probabalstic:
	- through inhibition of ribosomal subunits 40S und 80S, translation is slowed down and only highly specific
