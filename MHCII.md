aliases: [MHC2, mhcii]
tags:
 - protein_complex
 - protein/signalling
 - antigen_presentation
---
- present on [[monocytes]] and other [[APC]]s, such as [[ b cells]]
	- constitutively expressed 
- inducible on fibroblasts, epithelial cells and andothelial cells follow exposure of cytokines such as [[ifngamma]]

- loading mostly through [[phagocytosis]], presentation of external antigens to cd4+ t cells

### factor binding
- the x box is upstream of the MHC class2 promotor
- y-box also upstream binding through [[nf-ya]], [[nf-yb]] and [[nf-yc]]
	- distort the DNA thorugh binding and enhance compression
- x2 box is bound by [[CREB]], although not essential for HLA-DRA transcription
	- CREB more likely stabilises the X1-box
		- mechanism may be uinique to MHC2
- X1-box is bound by [[RFX5]] and its family members [[RFXAP]], [[RFX-B]]
	- these form a hetero tetramer
- a combination of xbox and ybox binding recruits [[CIITA]]
- W box may have interactions with [[CIITA]], may have an interesting binding target 

### histone remodelling 

#### acetylation
- multiple complexes are recruited to the MHCii promotors 
- [[histone 4]] acetylation following  [[ifngamma]] treatment cccured in parallel with [[RNA pol 2|rnapol2]] recruitment, preceeding transcriptional initiation
	- H4Ac
- [[histone 3]] acetylation increased with production of mRNA and were dependent on RNApol2
	- H3Ac
- [[CBP_p300 ]] functions as a [[HAT]] which is recruited to the locus by [[CIITA]]
	- similar mechanisms for [[PCAF]] and [[GCN5]]
- these recuited acetyltransferases work as part of the [[ATAC]]  and [[SAGA]] complexes, which are resposible for the the activation associated marks at the promotors 
	- the STAGA form of the SAGA complex is involved here
- atpase [[Sug1]] is required for increased acetylation or mark stability  at the mhc2 promotors
	- also recuits cbp to mhc2 genes
	- [source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18662994/)
- histone acetylation (hyperacetylation) can lead to mhc2 transcription in absence of ciita 
	- multiple roles for of acetylation 
	- [source1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1360741/)
	- [source2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC153210/)
- histone acetylation on histone 4 over a large (>5kb) domain upstream of the TSS is observed afert ifn gamma stimulus

#### methylation
- associates with [[COMPASS_MLL]], with several of the component also being pulled down 
	- also recruited are [[BRE1]] and [[UTX1]] in the context of ifngamma stimulus 
- when stimlated with ifngamma, [[PML]] associated with MLL, causing relocation of mhc2 promotors to pml nuclear bodies 
	-  important for [[H3K4me2]] at the mhc2 promotors
	- [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2849471/)
	- together, these factors suggest a mechanism of transcriptional memory of chromosomal restructuring with long lasting effects 

#### other 
- remodelling of nucleosome structure by [[SWI_SNF]] complex and nucleosome eviction at the w-x-y box was important for proper expression 
	- apparently, the establishment of a nucleosome free promotor region usually happens through strong nucleosome positioning signals 
	- in this case, it happens through factor binding to the w-x-y box
- [[CTCF]] can bind to sites C1 and XL9, flanking the HLA-DRA locus, which is required for robust expression 
	- 17 CTCF sites were identified within the MHC2 locus 
	- this binding happens in the inactive state
	- in the active state, ciita associates with the ctcf sites

## Promotors and enhancers 
- has a enhancer just downstream of the promotor region (-100 bp)
- a secondary enhancer lires -2.3 kb downstream of the TSS
- lacks the classical [[TATA-box]] amnd/or similar initiator sequences
