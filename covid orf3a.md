- one of the [[covid]] proteins 
- thought to be a viropirin
- only characterised in SARS-CoV1 
- only encoded in human pathogenic coronaviruses
- when overexpressed, it activates [[NLRP3]] in [[monocytes]]
	- talking about Sars-CoV1 here
	- similar result shave been published in a preprint in epithelial cells
