aliases: [NR3C1, glucocorticoid receptor]
---
- receptor for [[dexamethasone]] 
- also known as NR3C1
- membrane-bound GRs (mGR) are upregulated by [[LPS]] and downregulated by [[dexamethasone|glucocorticoids]] 
- transactivation: after nuclear translocation, the GC-GR as a homodimer binds to  glucocorticoid response elements in the promotor regions, causing transcriptional shift
	- positive GREs result in increased transcription
	- negative GREs result in the repression of the target gene 
- Tethering: monomeric GC-GR can bind other transcritption factors like [[nfkappab]] and [[AP-1]] or other nuclear coactivtors --> transcriptional inhibition ^838613
	- involves the GR interacting protein 1, GRIP1
	- GRIP1 can be phosphorylated and acts as a transcriptional repressor in combination with GR
- composite binding: binding of GR-GC simultaneously with another TF, which can have activating or inhibiting effects 
- GR is acetylated after binding, modulating its activity
	- [[HDAC2]] deacetylates GR, promoting the repression of [[nfkappab]] activity
