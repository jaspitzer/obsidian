monocyte inflammation  in covid 
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32661059/

# structure
- single stranded, positive sense RNA virus
- multiplie orf1
	- ORF1ab is the longest orf
		- codes for a multitude of npn structural proteins
		- are translated as poly proteins, [[pp1a]] and [[pp1b]]
		- both are cleaved by viral proteases encoded on ORF1a
		- [[covid nsp1]] is the most N terminal of these proteins
	- S 
	- [[covid orf3a]]
	- ORF3b
	- E
		- encodes [[covid e protein]]
	- M
	- ORF6
	- ORF7a
	- ORF7b
	- ORF8a
	- ORF8b
	- ORF9b
	- ORF9c
	- N
		- encodes [[covid n protein]]
