 - protein/histone
---
- ist a histone modification present on [[histone 3]]
- produces sharp peaks flanking the TSS
- intensitiy correlates with transcriptional activity
- the biggest peak maps to the 5' end of the body of active genes
	- associated with unmethylated cpg islands 
- also a dominant peak is at the end of the first exon, at the site of the 5' splice site 
- facilitates transcription initiation 
- is read by H3K4me3 reader [[TAF]]3 as part of transcriptional initiation 
- also read by [[PHF23]], which recruits the chromatin modification machinery
	- recruits [[sin3_hdac]] or [[KDM5B]] and [[ING proteins]]
	- read by  [[ING proteins|ING]] proteins
- bound by several [[HAT]]s 
- also linked to DNA damage and repair
- stable for ours or even days 
- is modified through lysine methyltransferases ([[KMT]]s)
- read by [[CXXC1]], which targets TSS that lack CpG islands 
- inhibition of proteasome can lead to spread of H3K4me3 into the gene body 
	- could work through the rapid deubiquitinylation of histone, allows uH2B independent KMT to facility the trimethylation
